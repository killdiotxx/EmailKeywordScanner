# EmailKeywordScanner
This Python script allows you to parse the body of an email from a specific sender. It retrieves the HTML content, converts it to plain text, and searches for keywords to extract specific information, which is then printed. The script also includes functionality to detect when a new email arrives from the same sender and performs the same action.
